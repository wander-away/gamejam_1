# game_jam1


My first game jam game ever!

  It is a basic shoot em up, where enemies spawn from the top of screen and fall down to the ground with varying speeds.

  You are a wizard who has to shoot fireballs to kill the enemy squares and get points.

  If 5 enemies fall down to the ground then it is game over!

  This game was created in Lua and the LOVE2D framework.
