My first game jam game ever!

  It is a basic shoot em up where enemies spawn from the top of screen and fall down to the ground with varying speeds.
  You as the player is a wizard who has to shoot red circle fireballs to kill the squares and get points. 
  If 5 enemies fall down to the ground then it is game over! Y
